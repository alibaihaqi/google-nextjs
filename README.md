# Google NextJS

## Getting Started

### Install Packages:
I used `bun` as a package manager, you can use other package managers, please refer based on your preference.

```bash
bun install
```

### Run the development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
